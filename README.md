# Textify App :
This Application is the product of teamwork by five students , created as an assignment project to enhance our Java programming skills. The objective of this app is to transcribe Youtube videos. it displays the text of a Youtube video uploaded by the user via a link and additionaly provides the ability to copy the transcribed text .

## Tools 
Some tools were necessary for the completion of this project , such as Yt-dlp. It is important to note that we initially tried to use ffmpeg with ytb-dl. However, with the suspension of ytb-dl, we opted to use yt-dlp as a solution . We also used Assembly AI for the transcription , which was easily implemented .
